# Development Process.
 ## Task 1
  - As you can see there are some files in the assets folder(`../app/assets/`).
  - We will be focusing on `tt.csv`.
  - Open the above mentioned file with Excel.
  - Also open the excel files from asset-info folder located at the top level of this repository.
  - First go to the Down timetable `sheet 2`.
  - Then using the train code (eg. T4 or A5) fill in the rows `FROM` & `TO` .
  - Leave the other rows as it is for now. Try to fill in as much you can.
 
 ## Task 2
  - Enable USB debugging in your phone.
  - Download `NDK`,`LLDB Debugger` & `CMake` from Android Studio>Settings>SDK Manager.
  - Connect your device to laptop.
  - Press the Run(Play) button and check whether `MainActivity.java` launches correctly or not.

We'll be also doing the programming part soon. I'll add the details tomorrow.
